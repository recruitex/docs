# 2. use-effect-on-backend

Date: 2024-05-07

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Co-author of this project wants to have a little bit of fun with the development, not to leave it after several days untouched.

## Decision

Usage of the [Effect](https://effect.website) will help with that significantly, as the mentioned person loves FP and admired Scala's ZIO for a very long time, so creating something useful and complex with Effect will be an awesome challenge.

## Consequences

Contributing to the backend part of open source will be more difficult due to the entry level of that library. On the other hand the solution should be more resiliant to variety of different errors due to the nature of Effect and type safety all over the place.
